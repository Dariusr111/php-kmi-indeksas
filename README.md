KMI (BMI) index calculator. <br>
Body Mass Index is a simple calculation using a person's height and weight.<br> 
The formula is BMI = kg/m2 where kg is a person's weight in kilograms and m2 is their height in metres squared. <br>
A BMI of 25.0 or more is overweight, while the healthy range is 18.5 to 24.9.. <br>
